                Unikernels are single-purpose appliances where an application is linked with everything
                that it needs, including kernel drivers, into a single binary which can be run in the cloud.

            <h1>Why I like Unikernels</h1>
            <p>
                Unikernels allow us to explore new ideas: to rethink old OS interfaces and to remove unnecessary
                layers of code accumulated over the last several decades.
                Modern general-purpose operating systems are fantastic, but they're so huge it's hard to
                experiment with totally different designs.
                Before the cloud, a research prototype OS would probably only be able to support one or two types of hardware.
                Now that we have common interfaces like Xen `netfront` and `blkfront` and `virtio-net` and `virtio-blk` it's feasible
                to write a new OS that can run on any cloud provider, using the hypervisor as a common substrate.
              </p>
            <h1>Unikernels are library OSes</h1>
            <p>
              Unikernels are also &quot;library OSes&quot; where network stacks and device drivers are libraries
              which are linked directly with the custom application logic into a single binary.
              We based our experiments on <a href="https://mirage.io">Mirage OS</a>,
              which has many nice libraries in OCaml including
                <ul>
                  <li><a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-tcpip">an OCaml TCP/IP stack</a></li>
                  <li><a href="https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-dns">an OCaml DNS client and server</a></li>
                  <li><a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-block-xen">an OCaml Xen disk driver</a></li>
                  <li><a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-net-xen">an OCaml Xen network driver</a></li>
                </ul>
                Note that
                since these are libraries, they can be used in other contexts too (not just unikernels).
                For example the TCP/IP stack can just as easily run in userspace on a traditional
                OS.
                Working at Docker, we were able to use the unikernel TCP/IP stack to solve
                some tricky
                <a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/how-docker-desktop-networking-works-under-the-hood/">
                    networking problems in Docker Desktop
                </a>.
                The same <a href="https://github.com/moby/vpnkit">vpnkit</a> tool (based on the Mirage OS libraries) can also be used to provide network
                connectivity to containers running in <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/">docker's rootless mode</a>.

            <h1>Unikernels are a good choice for high-assurance applications</h1>
            <p>
              Due to only linking code that is actually needed, unikernels have a naturally reduced attack
              surface compared to traditional applications.
              My favourite example is the &quot;xenstore&quot; service of the Xen hypervisor.
              In Xen, the hypervisor focuses on isolating untrusted VMs from each other, but does not perform any
              I/O directly. I/O is delegated to special privileged VMs called &quot;driver domains&quot;.
              The connections between the driver domains and the user VMs are configured via a control
              service called &quot;xenstore&quot;.
            </p>
            <p>
              <center>
                <img src="xen.png" alt="Xen architecture" width="600px">
                <br>
                The xenstore service in Xen configures connections between driver domains and user VMs
                <br>
              </center>
            </p>
            <p>
              The xenstore service is a critical part of a Xen host, so we must be confident that it's
              rock solid. Normally the xenstore service runs as a regular Linux process in a &quot;domain zero&quot;,
              a trusted VM. Running as a regular process means that it's open to interference from
              other processes, perhaps via signals or shared files or shared memory.
              Luckily for us there was already a fast, memory-safe implementation of xenstore written in OCaml, which we
              could then 
              <a href="https://mirage.io/blog/xenstore-stub-domain">port to run as an isolated unikernel VM</a>
              using MirageOS,
              increasing our confidence in the overall security of the system.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thanks to the library-based design, we could also increase the fault-tolerance of xenstore by
              using the
              <a href="https://irmin.org">OCaml Irmin (git-like) database</a> library
              <a href="https://mirage.io/blog/introducing-irmin-in-xenstore">to store the xenstore state</a>.
              This means that if the xenstore VM crashes, it can recover from a snapshot of its state.
              Here's our prototype &quot;Xenstore TNG&quot; showing a simulation of booting lots of VMs concurrently:

              Driver domains on a Xen host could in theory be compromised by buggy drivers.
              For example, a network driver domain could be compromised by a remote attacker over the Internet.
              <a href="https://roscidus.com/">Thomas Leonard</a> was able to use a MirageOS unikernel to improve the security of
              <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org">QubesOS</a>
              (modestly self-described as &quot;<em>a reasonably secure</em>&quot; operating system!).
              Thomas used a
              <a href="https://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2016/01/01/a-unikernel-firewall-for-qubesos/">MirageOS unikernel
              for the trusted firewall component</a>, which sits between the untrusted network driver VMs
              and the user application VMs.The firewall VM is the
              last line of defence between the user applications and the hostile Internet.

            <h1>Unikernels allow experimentation</h1>
            <p>
              Traditional OSes have mature but relatively fixed interfaces between kernel and user code. Since unikernels run
              everything linked together in the same binary, we can experiment with new interfaces more easily.
              We did a fun experiment where
              <a href="/papers/final/2015-nsdi-jitsu.pdf">we spawned unikernels in response to network requests</a>,
              and were able to hide the VM startup latency by accepting the TCP connection in a separate
              &quot;inetd-like&quot; process, and then when the unikernel was ready, we transmitted the TCP
              connection state (sequence numbers etc) over shared memory to the unikernel. This was easy to do because
              the TCP/IP stack was a library which we could easily customize.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since we worked on MirageOS, several other interesting unikernel projects have appeared.
              <a href="https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft">UniKraft</a>
              is a &quot;unikernel development kit&quot; that supports running existing applications
              (not just OCaml) as unikernels.
              I really appreciate their Docker-inspired UX:
              <pre>$ kraft run unikraft.org/helloworld:latest</pre>
            Also worth checking out is
            <a href="https://github.com/nanovms/nanos">Nanos</a>, which I notice also has
            <a href="https://github.com/nanovms/ops-examples/tree/master/ocaml/01-hello-world">OCaml support</a>.
            Nanos has several interesting additional features, including a
            <a href="https://nanovms.com/dev/tutorials/applying-sandbox-security-node-js-unikernels-openbsd-pledge-unveil">OpenBSD-style pledge and unveil</a>
            and <a href="https://nanovms.com/dev/tutorials/confidential-computing-with-amd-sev-enabled-unikernels">support for confidential computing via AMD SEV</a>.
            I'm also excited to see upstream Linux embrace Unikernel-style approaches with
            <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3552326.3587458">Unikernel Linux (UKL)</a> which treats Linux itself as a library
            which can be linked directly against a single process.
