            <p>Microsoft <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/skype-is-retiring-in-may-2025-what-you-need-to-know-2a7d2501-427f-485e-8be0-2068a9f90472">retiring Skype</a> and merging it with Teams
            brought back many memories, including of a research project at <a href="https://www.fraserresearch.org/">Fraser Research</a>
            with <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/">Anil Madhavapeddy</a>.
            In the early days of the Internet things were fairly simple (although low-level): your computer had a (at least one) public
            IP address, usually with a friendly DNS name associated.
            You could run a &quot;server&quot; on your machine and anyone could
            connect to it by the IP or by name. Sadly this simplicity didn't last: the scarcity of IPv4 addresses led
            to IP address sharing via Network Address Translation (NAT), and firewalls proliferated,
            blocking incoming connections. It just became too inconvenient to run a server locally.
            What could be done?
            </p>
            <p>One of the reasons Skype was magical was that it &quot;just worked&quot;. You could
            connect a video call to a friend with one-click, as if the NAT boxes and firewalls simply
            didn't exist. Behind the scenes it used techniques like
            <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5389">STUN</a> and relays
            to traverse NATs.
            In theory any application can implement
            <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5389">STUN</a>/
            <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5766">TURN</a>/
            <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8445">ICE/
            <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8835">WebRTC</a>
            and connect via some kind
            of coordination server.
            However that's a lot of work, and most applications even today just want 
            to &quot;bind&quot; on a port:
            </p>
            <pre>docker run -p 80:80 nginx</pre>
            <h1>Could the network be more like Skype?</h1>
            <p> Skype &quot;just worked&quot; and had an ultra-simple single-click UI.
              Could the network experience be more like Skype?
              </p>
            <p>Luckily for us, Skype had a API which would allow plugins to list contacts, initiate calls and send/receive
              messages.
              We built a prototype which queried your Skype contacts and listed them with
              a big "Connect" button next to each. When clicked, the app would first
              send a connection request to the contact, and if accepted, the app
              would discover both public IP addresses and ports and share the
              required connection details. Since these were the days before
              <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">Wireguard</a>
              we used
              <a href="https://openvpn.net/client/">OpenVPN</a>
              to create a secure tunnel. We used a random available
              <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1918">RFC1918</a>
              IP address range for the tunnel,
              so also ran a local DNS server to map the contact's name to the internal IP address.
              Since this was a research project we tested the network in the traditional way:
              by playing Quake 3. We had a lot of fun, and well, it demonstrated the priciple. 
            </p>
            <center>
              <img src="quake.png" alt="Quake 3 running over a VPN connection coordinated by Skype" width="600">
              <p>(from memory) roughly how it worked</p>
            </center>
            <p>
              One limitation of the initial prototype was that it was &quot;all or nothing&quot;:
              once a VPN was established between two machines, all ports (and therefore all
              applications) were available. We needed to make it easy for a user to grant access
              to an application and not to others. 
              Later this led to a fun project
              where we experimented with
              <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fuse.html">FUSE</a>
              on macOS to create a Plan 9-inspired filesystem-like interface to the network.

            <h1>Back to the present: Enter containers</h1>
            <p>
              This work pre-dated containerisation, but if I was doing it again I would
              use Docker to run the applications in containers. Docker already virtualizes
              the network, controls how ports are exposed, and uses similar techniques such
              as
              <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/networking/">a local DNS server</a>
              to map friendly container names to internal IP addresses.
              It seems a small step to grant access to a quake server running in a
              Docker network to friend using a protocol like
              <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> rather than Skype.
